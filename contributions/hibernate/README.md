### Changes for the contribution's documentation:

== Headline == 

[[Object-Relational mapping]] for [[Language:Java|Java]] with [[Technology:Hibernate|Hibernate]]

== Motivation ==

[[Object-Relational mapping]] or [[persistence]] on the Java platform is exercised using 
[[Technology:Hibernate]]. The primary data model for companies is a straightforward
object model for [[POJO]]s. A mapping is defined to associate a relational schema
with the classes. The mapping is specified by [[Technology:JPA]] annotations and organized
in a per-class manner. For each class, properties and [[relationship]]s are specified by
the mapping. It is insightful to compare the object model and the mapping-implied relational
schema. It is also insightful to compare the latter schema with one that was ''natively'' 
designed from a relational database point of view; see [[Contribution:mySqlMany]]. In 
particular, the object model and the implied relational schema are essentially "optimized" 
for downwards traversal of the company structure whereas a native relational schema would
rather provide foreign keys for upwards navigation (such as navigating from an employee to
its department or company).

== Illustration ==

Consider the following sketch of the class for departments:

<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
@Entity
@Table(name="DEPARTMENT")
public class Department {

	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
	@Column(name="ID")
	private Long id;
	
	@Column(name="NAME")
	private String name;
	
	@OneToMany(cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
	@JoinColumn(name="DEPT_ID")
	private Set<Employee> employees;
	
	@OneToMany(cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
	@JoinColumn(name="DEPT_ID")
	private Set<Department> subdepts;

	public Long getId() { ... }
	private void setId(Long id) { ... }
	public String getName() { ... }
	public void setName(String name) { ... }
	public Set<Employee> getEmployees() { ... }
	private void setEmployees(Set<Employee> employees) { ... }
	public Set<Department> getSubdepts() { ... }
	private void setSubdepts(Set<Department> subdepts) { ... }
}
</syntaxhighlight>

Each persistent class must provide a property (i.e., a getter and a setter) for
an ''id'' that can serve as primary key in the database. Properties of 
collection types (in fact, set types) proxy for one-to-many relationships.
Annotations are added to associate classes with a relational schema.
They can be used in addition to, but preferably as a replacement of XML mapping metadata.
Other than that, a persistent class is not much different from a regular
[[POJO]]-like class. (There are some private setters that would be missing
from a native object model. These setters are needed for object population.)

Consider the Annotations used to map class ''Department'' to table ''DEPARTMENT'':
@Entity marks the class as an entity, i.e. a persistent POJO class.
@Table takes arguments to define the table names and other properties for your
entity mapping. If no @Table is defined some default values are used.

All other properties of the class are associated with the table.
That is, the ''id'' property is directly mapped to a primary key column
by use of @Id. @GeneratedValue allows the application to set
the property itself, i.e. generate some identifier for your entity.

Also, the ''name'' property is mapped to a column of just that name---applying
default mapping rules between SQL types and Java types. Further, the ''employees''
property is non-trivially associated with a foreign key ''DEPT_ID'' of the 
''EMPLOYEE'' table by use of the @OneToMany annotation. This is only
indirectly identified through the mentioning of the ''Employee'' class; likewise for sub-departments.

Persistent objects are brought back to life as follows:

<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
public Company loadCompany(String name) {
		this.session = getSessionFactory().getCurrentSession();
		this.session.beginTransaction();
		List<?> result = this.session.createQuery(
				"from Company where name = '" + name + "'").list();
		for (Object o : result)
			return (Company)o;
		return null;
	}
</syntaxhighlight>

That is, an [[Language:HQL]] query is executed to retrieve a company 
that is identified by name; the Hibernate framework takes care of populating
the company object and all its sub-objects. If the requested company cannot be found,
then ''null'' is returned.

Finally, consider the Hibernate configuration:

<syntaxhighlight lang="xml">
<hibernate-configuration>
	<session-factory>
		<!-- Database connection settings. -->
		<property name="connection.driver_class">org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver</property>
		<property name="connection.url">jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost:9001</property>
		<property name="connection.username">sa</property>
		<property name="connection.password"></property>
		<!-- Create the database schema, if needed; update otherwise -->
		<property name="hbm2ddl.auto">update</property>				  			  
		<!-- mappings for annotated classes -->
        <mapping class="org.softlang.company.Employee"/>  	
        <mapping class="org.softlang.company.Department"/>  
        <mapping class="org.softlang.company.Company"/>  	
	...
	</session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>
</syntaxhighlight>

This configuration helps the runtime to connect to the right database, to find
all mapping files of interest, and to define some essential settings. For instance,
Hibernate is informed here that the database catalog is to be updated automatically
(see ''hbm2ddl.auto'' ... ''update'') upon starting a Hibernate session. In particular,
if the mapping-implied tables are not yet declared in the database, then they will
be created automatically.

== Architecture ==

Package ''org.softlang.company'' hosts the java object model for [[Feature:Hierarchical company]].
Package ''org.softlang.features'' provides functionality for [[Feature:Total]] and [[Feature:Cut]]
as well as boilerplate code for [[Feature:Persistence]]. The folder ''scripts'' contains SQL-scripts
to create and populate the tables (there is no need to execute these statements, see workflow described below).
The Hibernate configuration file is located in src/main/resources dir. The HSQLDB database files are located in the data dir.


# Usage
Please follow these steps carefully.

## Start from a clean setup
Upon checking out the implementation, you are clean.

For further testing,
it is recommended to execute *clean* and *populate* to reset the database state.

## Build the project
This is a Gradle Project.
Everything is included.

The project should build fine in any IDE that supports Gradle.
Eclipse and IntelliJ support Gradle natively in their latest versions.

We have 4 different Gradle tasks for you to easily run the tests and you therefore don't need to care about the database server as much.

### Gradle tasks

You can find the Gradle tasks in the group 'database'.

### *start*
This task starts the database in the background.

### *stop*
As the name says, this task will stop the database server.

### *clear*
This command clears the database completely.

### *populate*
This will fill the database with all the sample data provided and is required for the tests.
To reset the data it is recommended to execute *clear* and then *populate* to start fresh.

### *openDbManager*
This will open the Database Manager so you can verify or debug various things.

## Proper testing
Several test cases are collected in package org.softlang.tests:

* Run the JUnit test *Check* for checking for the ranking constraint. This test does not modify the state of the database. This test succeeds repeatedly (since even the cut transformation does not end up violating the constraint).
* Run the JUnit test *Query* for computing the salary total. This test does not modify the state of the database. This test succeeds repeatedly for as long as the computed total equals the baseline that is hard-coded in that test.
* Run the JUnit test *TransformNoSave* for cutting all salaries. This test does not modify the state of the database. This test succeeds repeatedly (since the totals before and after cut are compared without using any hard-coded baseline for total).
* Run the JUnit test *TransformAndSave* for cutting all salaries. This test modifies the state of the database and thus makes fail test *Query*. This test succeeds repeatedly (since the totals before and after cut are compared without using any hard-coded baseline for total).

## Finish off
Just execute *stop* and quit the database monitor.
